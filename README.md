# Prestashop 1.7 product weight pack
Modification for prestashop which enables counting delivery weight of products packed in bundles - for Dropshipping.

Code enables to count weight of products in cart based on package weight rather than a single product. For example, if a certain product has a package containing four items, but you can sell any number of them you can use this code to optimize delivery cost in Your shop.

Useful for Dropshipping deliveries, where you don't send the packages yourself.

In situation, when Your cost of delivery is the same for a number of pieces of certain product, because of the size of package, this code will allow You to sell them with exactly the same delivery price in any number of pieces within pack capacity.

# For code to work you have to:
- use delivery price based on weight
- add a column to product table and insert for products a number of pieces in a package they are packed

This code solved a problem with Prestashop delivery costs I've encountered, so maybe it will help someone else.
